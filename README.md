# Credit-Card-Fraud-PySpark

In this repository we will try to detect whether a credit card transaction was fraud or not. We will be doing this by implementing a Logistic Regression with PySpark. We will then evaluate our model and change it accordingly. The dataset used for this project is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
